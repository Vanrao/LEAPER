Student's data will be logged in input.txt

createData.py - Runs readFile.js on all the student data to get the opcode formatted lists

getTreeFormats.py - Gets all the tree format data form the opcodes to give it as input to the TreeEditdistance jar file

TreeScoresForAll.py - Creates CSVs for each student for Level-1 and level-2 separately.

Note: There are separate folders maintained for each type of data gathered. Paths need to be carefully changed if codes are executed locally on your systems.

Integrate the CSVs(results of TreeScoresForAll.py) into UI dashboards for each student.
