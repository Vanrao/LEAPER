Together with the [Scratch Virtual Machine (VM)](https://github.com/LLK/scratch-vm) this codebase allows for the rapid design and development of visual programming interfaces.\n\n*This project is in active development and should be considered a \"developer preview\" at this time.*\n\n## Two Types of Blocks\n\n![](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/747641/15255731/dad4d028-190b-11e6-9c16-8df7445adc96.png)\n\nScratch Blocks brings together two different programming \"grammars\" that the Scratch Team has designed and continued to refine over the past decade. The standard [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu) grammar uses blocks that snap together vertically, much like LEGO bricks. For our [ScratchJr](https://scratchjr.org) software, intended for younger children, we developed blocks that are labelled with icons rather than words, and snap together horizontally rather than vertically. We have found that the horizontal grammar is not only friendlier for beginning programmers but also better suited for devices with small screens.\n\n## Documentation\nThe \"getting started\" guide including [FAQ](https://scratch.mit.edu/developers#faq) and [design documentation](https://github.com/LLK/scratch-blocks/wiki/Design) can be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/LLK/scratch-blocks/wiki).\n\n## Donate\nWe provide [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu) free of charge, and want to keep it that way! Please consider making a [donation](https://secure.donationpay.org/scratchfoundation/) to support our continued engineering, design, community, and resource development efforts. Donations of any size are appreciated. Thank you!\n",
